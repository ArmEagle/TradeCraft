- repairshop has it's own handling code  /  enable repair shop


Digi said:
 - Also, could you add a feature to place signs ON chests (like Lockette) ?
 - Protection of chest contents while you're using it... or something, so other people don't just sit by and wait for you to buy and steal your stuff.
 - The sign labels would be better understood if they're: "Buy 5 for 1" and "Sell 5 for 1" and you should suppot texts like "Buy 5 for 1g" or "Buy5for1" etc.
 
 - limit currency and configured items to valid data values
 - Allow administrators to disable infinite shops using a command and storing that setting in TradeCraft.properties.
 - Allow setting of currency by name (basic names from Bukkit, or also as defined in config?) again.
 - warn when config files use old format?
 
 Coding issue:
 - chest.getContents --> item.getData().getData() always seems to return 0, workaround with using getDurability which accesses the same data. 
 - items with 'damage' bits too high will act as the basic item, but cannot be traded or stacked as such. Be careful not to create these.
 
 
 Done: 
 - [launch player]  triggers infinite shop check
 - (gsand) Would it be possible to make it so players can buy 6 items for 2 gold, but not 3 for 1 gold.
 - The wool, dye, log, etc sub-items (just re-mentioning, I understand it's gonna be possible in #564+)
 - Additional information about current amount of items and currency available when right clicking as client.
 - You don't have to write your name on the sign of a player shop anymore. Also, too long names will be stored just fine, but will show abbreviated on the sign.
