- Would it be possible to make it so players can buy 6 items for 2 gold, but not 3 for 1 gold.

 - Also, could you add a feature to place signs ON chests (like Lockette) ?
 - The wool, dye, log, etc sub-items (just re-mentioning, I understand it's gonna be possible in #564+)
 - Protection of chest contents while you're using it... or something, so other people don't just sit by and wait for you to buy and steal your stuff.
 - The sign labels would be better understood if they're: "Buy 5 for 1" and "Sell 5 for 1" and you should suppot texts like "Buy 5 for 1g" or "Buy5for1" etc.
 - The sign shouldn't require you to type your name since you can only make shops for yourself, it should overwrite the last line with your nickname.
 - Additional information about current amount of items and currency available when right clicking as client.

 
 
MOVE TradeCraft.getShopFromSignBlock(Player player, Block block) {
 Which creates the actual shops, to the sign change code, that way we have a handle on the player who
 placed the chest and can put down the full name. Which already seems to happen partially, but not for real?!
