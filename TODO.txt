- repairshop has it's own handling code  /  enable repair shop


Digi said:
 - Also, could you add a feature to place signs ON chests (like Lockette) ?
 - Protection of chest contents while you're using it... or something, so other people don't just sit by and wait for you to buy and steal your stuff.
 - The sign labels would be better understood if they're: "Buy 5 for 1" and "Sell 5 for 1" and you should suppot texts like "Buy 5 for 1g" or "Buy5for1" etc.
 - The sign shouldn't require you to type your name since you can only make shops for yourself, it should overwrite the last line with your nickname.
 
?MOVE TradeCraft.getShopFromSignBlock(Player player, Block block) {
 Which creates the actual shops, to the sign change code, that way we have a handle on the player who
 placed the chest and can put down the full name. Which already seems to happen partially, but not for real?!
 
 - limit currency and configured items to valid data values
 - Allow administrators to disable infinite shops using a command and storing that setting in TradeCraft.properties.
 - Allow setting of currency by name (basic names from Bukkit, or also as defined in config?) again.
 
 
 Coding issue:
 - chest.getContents --> item.getData().getData() always seems to return 0, workaround with using getDurability which accesses the same data. 
 
 
 Done: 
 - [launch player]  triggers infinite shop check
 - (gsand) Would it be possible to make it so players can buy 6 items for 2 gold, but not 3 for 1 gold.
 - The wool, dye, log, etc sub-items (just re-mentioning, I understand it's gonna be possible in #564+)
 - Additional information about current amount of items and currency available when right clicking as client.
